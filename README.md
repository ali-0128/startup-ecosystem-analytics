# Startup Ecosystem Analytics
### End-to-End Data Analysis Pipeline | Crunchbase 2013

> **Analyzing $419.7B in startup funding across 196K companies, 175 countries, and 52K funding rounds to answer: What factors determine a startup's ability to raise higher funding or reach Acquisition / IPO?**

---

## Project Background

This project was developed as a **Final Graduation Project** for the **NTI (National Telecommunications Institute) — Data Analysis Track**, Egypt.

It performs a complete end-to-end data analysis of the global startup ecosystem using the [Crunchbase 2013 Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/) dataset — covering real startup activity from 1990 up to December 2013.

## Strategic Question

> *"What factors determine a startup's ability to raise higher funding or reach Acquisition / IPO?"*

Broken into **4 analytical axes:**

| Axis | Business Question |
|---|---|
| Funding Analysis | Which sectors attract the most capital? What round types yield the highest amounts? |
| Startup Journey | What % of startups reach exit? How long from founding to first funding? |
| Investor Analysis | Who are the most active investors? Where do they focus? |
| Geographic Analysis | Which countries and cities dominate? Is Silicon Valley still king? |

## Pipeline Overview

```
Raw CSV (Kaggle)
      ↓
Python — 11 tables cleaned, zero duplicates, dtypes corrected
      ↓
SQL Server — Star schema, 15 FK constraints, ERD verified
      ↓
Power Query — Type corrections, date extraction, null handling
      ↓
Power BI — Star schema model, 11 DAX measures, 6-page dashboard
      ↓
GitHub — Documented repository
```

## Data Cleaning Highlights

- **11 tables** processed — **zero duplicate rows** across all tables
- **Date columns**: never imputed — missing dates preserve logical meaning
- **Foreign Key nulls**: rows dropped — cannot be joined to any table
- **Columns > 75% null**: dropped — no analytical value
- **category_code nulls** → filled with `'unknown'` (required for chart grouping)
- **funding_total_usd nulls** → filled with `0` (null = no funding = $0)
- **offices (0,0) coordinates** → filtered (invalid mid-ocean coordinates)

## Database Schema

**Star Schema in SQL Server & Power BI:**

![Overview](/3_Database_SQL_Server/daigram.png)

![Overview](/4_Data_Visualization_PowerBI/modeling.png)


- **15 Foreign Key constraints** established in SQL Server
- **Inactive relationships** handled with `USERELATIONSHIP()` in DAX
- **Self-join** on `cleaned_objects.parent_id` for subsidiary hierarchy

## DAX Measures

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| `Total Raised USD` | SUM of raised_amount_usd |
| `Avg Raised per Round` | AVERAGE per round |
| `Median Raised` | MEDIAN — robust to outliers |
| `YoY Funding Growth` | Year-over-year % using DATEADD |
| `Success Rate %` | DIVIDE(Acquired + IPO, Total Companies) |
| `Avg Days to First Funding` | AVERAGEX with DATEDIFF |
| `Total Investments` | COUNTROWS(fac_investments) |
| `Investments by Investor` | CALCULATE + USERELATIONSHIP |
| `Avg Funding per Company` | DIVIDE(SUM, COUNTROWS) |
| `% of Total Funding` | DIVIDE with ALL() |
| `Round Size Category` | SWITCH on raised_amount_usd ranges |
